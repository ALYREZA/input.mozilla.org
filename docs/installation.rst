Vendor Library
--------------

Input uses a vendor library to manage its dependencies.  At the root of your
project you can aquire this vendor library::

    git clone git@github.com:mozilla/input-lib.git vendor --recursive

If you are on IT hardware and need to stay in the mozilla network:

    git clone git://gitmirror.mozilla.org/mozilla/input-lib vendor --recursive
