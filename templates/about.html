    <strong>Firefox Input</strong> is Mozilla's primary feedback mechanism. It is
    set up to be a method of one-way communication about your experiences in using
    Firefox, the Internet you view it through, and what Mozilla can do to make
    that experience better. The system is available over a wide-variety of
    submission mechanisms over all three major channels of builds.
